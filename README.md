### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What-I-Learned
To position the "Ready To  Build your community" section. Firstly, I brought it under footer section. Initially, it was above footer and I was having troubles positioning it and making it fully responsive.
After it was a child of footer section, I just used transform property to translate it vertically by -50%. That made sure, that this section always stayed at the middle of footer section at all sizes. So, I am little proud of this development.


### Continued development

Here I am changing values of width of images and sections, font-sizes and gap between elements. I get confused while making it responsive. Going from mobile to desktop. So, What I realised is that I get confused with the values. From next time on, I am going to declare those values as variables, so that I wouldn't have to change it everywhere everytime. Moreover, I can built a responsive website by just changing those variables to reduce development time.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://type-scale.com/) - This helped me to select font-sizes for different elements.
